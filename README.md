# Portfolio's Backend

My personal take on a portfolio, with a small back end to pull my projects from a database so it's easier for me to manage the site without having to redo it as I put more projects.

It's not really complex for now until at some point I decide I need to implement a CRUD for my projects (it's made so the projects are inserted manually on the database), or I decide I want the language switching system to come from the database (or maybe an administrator panel to manage my portfolio)
